Monitors blog.fefe.de and sends new blog postings via a telegram bot to a telegram user.

Does not crash or resend a blog post on failure to send a telegram message.

Make sure to set the 'bot-token' key and 'recipient' key correctly.

To fix the keys on startup, create a 'fefe.args' file and define these two keys there:

```
bot-token=...
recipient=...
```

To start this workflow, execute `scraper` in the same directory as `fefe.yf`. 
If it is not the only `yf` file, execute `scraper fefe.yf`instead.
