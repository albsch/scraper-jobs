Monitors mydealz.de and sends new deal postings via a telegram bot to a telegram user.

Make sure to set the 'bot-token' key and 'recipient' key correctly.

Choose a topic and set 'topic' appropriately. 
A topic is valid if it can be accessed via `mydealz.de/gruppe/TOPIC`.
If you want to monitor all deals, set the URL of the first HttpRequestNode to
`mydealz.de`.

To fix the keys on startup, create a 'mydealz.args' file and define the missing
keys.

To start this workflow, execute `scraper` in the same directory as `mydealz.yf`.
